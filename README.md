The GJ-HL-660 file contains content data on 12 functional components from 660 Gongju samples for model training and testing. In contrast, the GJ-HL-55 file includes the same 12 functional components from 55 new Gongju samples intended for external testing.
The GJ-SWYG-YS-660 file provides raw 3D fluorescence data from 660 Gongju samples for model training and testing, while the GJ-SWYG-YS-55 file contains raw 3D fluorescence data from 55 new Gongju samples for external testing.
The GJ-SWYG-SG-660 file features 3D fluorescence data from 660 chrysanthemum samples that have been pre-processed using SG for model training and testing. Conversely, the GJ-SWYG-SG-55 file contains the 3D fluorescence data from 55 new Gongju samples, also pre-processed by SG for external testing.
